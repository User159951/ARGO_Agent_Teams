# Team Research & Strategy

## Objective
Create an end‑to‑end pipeline able to **collect, verify, and synthesise information** into strategic insights and long‑form reports.

## Agents & Roles
| Agent | Main Capability |
|-------|-----------------|
| DeepKnowledge | Iterative knowledge‑base search + reasoning |
| Research Agent (NYT) | Journalistic writing, fact‑checking |
| Research Scholar (Exa) | Academic literature search & structured output |

| Media Trend Analyst | Detects media trends & influencers |
| Web Extraction Agent | Structured scraping of webpages |
| Social Media Analyst | Sentiment & brand intelligence on X |
| README Generator Agent | Creates technical READMEs |

## How It Works
1. **Routing** – The TeamAgent inspects the query and dispatches it to the most specialised agent.  
2. **Multi‑source Research** – Agents leverage Firecrawl, Exa, DuckDuckGo, etc.  
3. **Synthesis** – Output can be re‑fed into DeepKnowledge or Research Agent for final write‑up.

## Typical Use‑cases
- Competitive intelligence decks
- Market‑entry studies
- Executive trend briefings
